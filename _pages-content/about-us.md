### Separated by distance. United by Python.

PyCon India is a big yearly meeting of people who love and know a lot about Python in India. People who really like using Python come from all over the world to join and talk about how they use it and what they know. This conference is run by volunteers, and its goal is to help more people use and learn about the Python programming language. The 14th PyCon India will happen from September 29th to October 2nd, 2023 at JNTU Hyderabad. We're really excited to organize this in-person conference again after the pandemic.

#### What happens during the conference?

PyCon India 2023 consists of 3 events rolled into one mega event for 3 days of learning and fun:

#### Conference Days:

September 30th - October 1st, 2023 will be the Conference Days. On the conference days, people will be able to connect with other Pythonistas, discuss their experiences, present their ideas, and attend the talks, BoFs, and Poster Sessions.

#### Workshop Day :

Workshop Day will be on September 29th, 2023. On the workshop day, people can attend hands-on workshops, and learn about a topic they have been excited about, but didn't get the time or resources to learn about from an expert.

#### Devsprint :

The Developer Sprints will be on October 2nd, 2023. During the Devsprints, people can contribute to open-source projects, guided by mentors having experience with open-source and their projects. This is a great opportunity for people to start contributing to Python and other open-source projects.

#### What are BoFs and Poster Sessions? How one can submit these Proposals?

Birds of a Feather session, often referred to as BoFs, are casual meetups for people who share common interests. In these gatherings, participants come together to have informal discussions about a specific topic, without a fixed plan. BoFs create a relaxed environment where audience members actively join in, making it a type of informal panel conversation.

Posters serve as visual overviews of projects or concepts. During poster sessions, attendees have the chance to connect with others at the conference and use the posters as a launching point for deeper conversations and interactions.

#### Who are the organizers and what is our vision?

### Organized by the people, for the people

Every year, PyCon India comes together through the collaborative efforts of Python communities and user groups spanning India. This collective initiative combines their diverse experiences and skills, resulting in an increasingly impactful and inclusive conference. From inception to execution, the event is wholly managed by volunteers who work tirelessly, including planning, speaker selection, and smooth operation. Our extensive and passionate volunteer network comprises seasoned individuals from various Python communities across the nation.

Our aspiration is to share the collective wisdom and expertise of our community members with the wider public. We are dedicated to forging a responsible and all-encompassing environment where Python enthusiasts from various backgrounds can unite, sharing their narratives and gaining insights from others' journeys.

The Python programming language has evolved into an indispensable tool across a spectrum of professions, from programmers and mathematicians to doctors, scientists, security researchers, and hardware designers. Our goal is to ensure that the conference serves as a true reflection of our community's diversity. By fostering the exchange of ideas, knowledge, and experiences, we seek to enrich our entire community.

Furthermore, our commitment extends to ensuring that every individual is treated with respect. We aim for universal accessibility, irrespective of circumstances, and advocate for peaceful resolution in case of disagreements. You can also contribute by acquainting yourself with our guidelines and abiding by them.
